### Culminating Assignment
Create a computer game using PyGame. Ensure it saves data to a database. Use PANDAS to do a data analysis of the game. <br>
Click [here](https://github.com/Aulteran/Course-ICS4U-Notes/tree/main/CCA/script) for the game directory.
I also created a [readme file]() with the game instructions for how to play the game. <br>
The data analysis is included in a Jupyter Notebook in the game directory.<br>
